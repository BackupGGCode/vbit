# What could you do with this inserter? #

You may well be asking yourself what use is an inserter these days? I have some ideas about that. Some of the ideas are good, some are cool and some are quite frankly ridiculous. If you have any more ideas then please add them here, the sillier the better.

# Spectacularly Stupid Ideas for Inserter Applications #

  * Gaming in Mode 7, Tetris or Pong. Make use of the analog inputs of the XMEGA.
  * Oscilloscope. Again the analog inputs would come in useful. The 80 pixels across would be a bit of a limitation.
  * Electric Signage. Load up the SD card with a carousel and clip to the back of any TV with a CVBS input.
  * Weather Station. Display the data from a weather station.
  * Industrial Process Control. Make a mimic board for your nuclear power plant.
  * Railway switching mimic display. Probably best to use these for models, not the real thing.
  * Home automation. Show the state of the lighting in all your rooms, the curtains, the TV channels etc.
  * Aircraft instrumentation glass cockpit. Again, I doubt that the CAA would be impressed with instruments drawn in teletext graphics mode.
  * Twitter Feed display. Go on. You know you want it.
  * Analog clock. A clock with the hands animated in teletext graphics.
  * Kitchen timer. The coolest way to time your egg.
  * Screen saver.
  * RSS alerts.
  * Advertising opt-out signals.
