#summary Is VBIT suitable for broadcasting?

Short answer: No.

Long Answer: Perhaps

VBIT is based on the teletext generating capability of the SAA7121 chip. This has the advantages of not having too many pins to solder and is quite cheap. What we lose by using this chip is some quality as it only accepts 8 bit video. Professional equipment will typically use 10 bits. So the data path is already reduced and while the picture still looks very good it isn't up to professional standards. Also we have analogue in and out and most studios will at least be using SDI.

But you may still be able to use VBIT because while the composite image may be slightly lower resolution, this does not affect the text signal. And so if you have a databridge somewhere in the chain then you can insert the text from VBIT using that.
