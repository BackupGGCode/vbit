#summary MiniTED Teletext Editor

= Introduction =

MiniTED is a teletext editor. MiniTED used to be an editor sold by MRG Systems. This MiniTED has the same name but is a new development and is designed to run on 32 bit Windows systems.

= Capabilities =

It can be used to read, edit and write teletext pages and carousels. It handles language flags and other attributes. It also It also connects with the TED Scheduler server which in turn talks directly to other inserters. MiniTED Protocols included are MRG Serial, MRG Network, MRG BAG and Astet. VBIT is also under development. At September 2012 it is still in early development and many features are not implemented, such as graphics editing.


= Distribution =

MiniTED is still under development but if you would like to try MiniTED then you can get it from the Downloads section.

= Bugs =
Documents have pointers which are not handled correctly and so closed documents pop up again but empty. Ignore these phantom pages.


= Installation =
* Download TED.ZIP and unzip it in a temporary folder.
* Click on setup.exe
* Change the Project1 folder to something more meaningful like Minited. MiniTED is normally installed in c:\minited but c:\Program Files\minited will do.
* When it finally gets to copying it will probably say "A file being copied is older than the file currently on your system". When it says "Keep this file" always say "Yes".
* Before you run Minited make this directory structure:
 c:\minited\inserter
 c:\minited\Inserter\OnAir
 c:\minited\Inserter\Pages
 c:\minited\Inserter\User
 c:\minited\Inserter\Log
 c:\minited\Inserter\Readback
 c:\minited\Inserter\Schedule
 c:\minited\Inserter\Schedule\Archive
Now you have everything installed you can go back to the downloads section and grab OnAir.zip. Unzip this into the OnAir directory then you will have some pages that you can see how they are made.
