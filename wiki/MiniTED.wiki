#summary MiniTED Teletext Editor

= Introduction =

MiniTED is a teletext editor. MiniTED used to be an editor sold by MRG Systems. This MiniTED has the same name but is a new development and is designed to run on 32 bit Windows systems.

= Capabilities =

It can be used to read, edit and write teletext pages and carousels. It handles language flags and other attributes. It also It also connects with the TED Scheduler server which in turn talks directly to other inserters. MiniTED Protocols included are MRG Serial, MRG Network, MRG BAG and Astet. VBIT is also under development. At September 2012 it is still in early development and many features are not implemented, such as graphics editing.


= Distribution =

MiniTED is still under development but if you would like to try MiniTED then you can get it from the Downloads section.

= Bugs =
Documents have pointers which are not handled correctly and so closed documents pop up again but empty. Ignore these phantom pages.


= Installation =
It is supplied as a CAB file. This should be installed but at all the points where it says "Keep your existing file" you should accept this. Don't overwrite your newer dlls with my very old ones. This is because MiniTED has been compiled on a very old system. I hope to move this to an MSI package.

Not sure how it gets installed but the file structure c:\minited\ should have MiniTED placed in it.
