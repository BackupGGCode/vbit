#summary Setting up the MT-X1 Development board

= MT-X1 Dev Board =

The MT-X1 board replaced the old development board in June 2011. The hardware is a little different.

= Hardware Details =

You can get away with using a mini USB cable to program and run the board. You will need a Micro SD card to store teletext pages on. My local shops only stock 2GB cards and this is fine.
= Software Details = 
Go to the Mattair MT-X1 website and download everything on that page!

If you are using a Window PC then plug the board in using the USB. The driver should start to install. Point the driver at your downloaded INF file MT_X1.INF.
Start Hyperterminal and configure a new connection. The highest COM number is likely to belong to the board.
When you connect it should say "MT-X1 XMEGA Demo Program".
You should be able to run through the pre-installed demos.
= Installing VBIT =
VBIT connects to the dev. board by a data cable and a power cable.
* Put a 2x5 header at port pins C0 to D1.
* Put a 1x2 header in any slot marked GND 3V3. The one on the end of Port D is most convenient.
* If you have a JTAG programmer like AVRDRAGON or AVR JTAGICE MkII then fit a 2x5 header in the JTAG port.
