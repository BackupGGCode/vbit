#summary What you need to get started with VBIT
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

You'll need to build the hardware. You must have the ability to assemble surface mount boards and stick down TQFP chips with confidence. Unless this project really takes off I can not manufacture boards for you.
If you want to develop code then be aware that this

= Hardware =
The hardware is two parts. A processor board that you buy ready made and a video board that you will have to make.
  * Buy the JM-XD200-USB board from http://xmega.mattair.net/index.html
  * You'll also need a miniusb cable to go with it.
  * A VBIT board. Contact me if you want to buy a bare board. I have a few in stock made by Beta Layout. They do need a few patches.
  * The project has circuit diagrams, gerbers and a bill of materials that I will post if anyone needs it.

= Software =
The software is in three broad categories, namely tools, libraries and source code.
==Tools==
  * Atmel AVR Studio 4. Used for programming the XMEGA via the AVRISP simulator.
  * Atmel Flip. Used for programming the AVR USB SPI Bridge.
  * WinAVR. The toolchain including compiler and linker
  * You may also like to download the demo code for the JM-SD200-USB board as it contains many useful examples and it may have better USB bridge code.
==Libraries==
These libraries may need to be installed.
  * LUFA is the Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs.
  * FatFS is the FAT filing system that is used to read the SD card.
==Source Code==
This is the actual VBIT code. I need to examine the code and replace any non-GPL parts that may be in there before it can be released.
