#summary TED Scheduler is a Windows program that is used to control teletext inserters.

= Introduction =

TED Scheduler was a product of http://www.mrgsystems.co.uk. It was used to control various types of teletext inserter in conjunction with MiniTED. TED Scheduler can control most of MRG's inserters. It can also control Astet devices like Atom, Quark and TDG7. It has now been updated to control VBIT. TED Scheduler is not yet freely distributable. If you would like to try TED Scheduler then please contact me, Peter Kwan. 

= Scheduling =

TED Scheduler operates by creating schedules. Schedules sometimes operate immediately or they can be timed. Schedules can also repeat. Schedules are simple text files that contain a schedule time and a list of commands. TED Scheduler comes with two schedules already installed and these are used for deleting old log entries. Other schedules can be added to set the time and date and this is very useful for VBIT which has no battery backed up real time clock.

For each inserter there is a Schedule folder. For single inserter systems this is usually in c:\minited\inserter\schedule. As soon as a schedule is written to this folder and the schedule execution time is reached, the schedule will be executed. Once executed it will be moved to the Archive sub folder. If the schedule is marked as a repeating schedule then the schedule will be rescheduled accordingly. 

MiniTED, the teletext editor is designed to write TED Schedules. When the Send button is clicked a schedule is written out for immediate transmission. The schedule contains a command to send the page.

Schedules can be created by any method that is convenient including Notepad. For example, the weather could be read in by XML, and transformed to a schedule file by XSL. 

= File Structure =
The root of the system is expected to be c:\minited\. TED Scheduler is in a sub folder at c:\minited\inserter. The executable is inserter.exe. The supported inserter types are defined in InsTypes.ini. The initialisation are in inserter.ini. The sub folders are
* Log - Log of scheduler activity 
* OnAir - Pages that are currently on air
* Pages - A library of Pages
* Readback - Pages that have been read back from an inserter (used mainly for inserters that can capture pages)
* Schedule - Schedule files to control the inserter. There is also an Archive sub folder where the schedule files go after being executed.
* User - Similar to Pages. Not really sure how old MiniTED handles users.

= TED Scheduler and VBIT =
VBIT is partially supported. It is possible to upload new pages. It can also set the header time and details. For a new system we will assume that you are using the standard setup of MiniTED in c:\minited\. The TED Scheduler executable should be placed at
c:\minited\inserter\inserter.exe. It also requires the INI file or it will get terribly confused. To configure the system you should run this and then set up communications as follows:
== VBIT Comm Port ==
This assumes that you have plugged in VBIT and installed the serial port driver INF file. To find the VBIT Comm port you can try using TED Scheduler. Under the tabs Setup->Connection make sure that Com Port is selected. Then press the Comms Setup... button. Your COM port will probably be the highest number port in the list. Select Direct to COM4 or whatever it is. As a virtual com port the baud rate is irrelevant so ignore this.
